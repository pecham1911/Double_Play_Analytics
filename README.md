Overview

Business Understanding

In the highly competitive and financially driven landscape of professional baseball, accurately predicting game outcomes can significantly impact team performance, fan engagement, and revenue generation. By leveraging historical game data our predictive modeling approach aims to provide teams, broadcasters, and stakeholders with actionable insights into future game outcomes. This predictive analytics tool will empower teams to optimize their strategies, such as player selection, pitching rotations, and in-game tactics, leading to improved win rates and overall performance. Additionally, broadcasters can enhance viewer experience by offering more informed pre-game analysis and real-time predictions during broadcasts. Ultimately, a reliable predictive model for baseball game outcomes has the potential to drive fan excitement, increase ticket sales, and attract valuable sponsorships, thus contributing to the long-term success and profitability of baseball organizations.
