# Double Play Analytics

This is an advanced baseline baseball analytics project from which to build additional products. This is being coined as baseline because it includes a single dataset and standard outcome predictions. It utilizes decision trees to understand feature importance and ...logistic regression... and finally neural networds to....

Predictive Modeling for Game Outcomes: Utilize past game data to predict the outcome of future games. You can frame this as a classification problem (win/loss) or a regression problem (predicting the score difference). Features could include team performance metrics, starting pitchers, umpire ratings, etc.

Player Performance Analysis: Analyze player performance over time. You can calculate various statistics like batting average, ERA, on-base percentage, etc. Visualize player performance trends and identify top performers or underperformers.

Home Field Advantage Analysis: Investigate the concept of home field advantage. Analyze whether certain teams have a statistically significant advantage when playing at home compared to away. Explore factors contributing to this advantage, such as crowd attendance, familiarity with the stadium, etc.

Pitching Strategies and Performance: Analyze pitching strategies and their effectiveness. Look into pitch types, locations, and sequencing. Determine which pitching strategies are most effective against different types of batters.

Umpire Analysis: Investigate the impact of different umpires on game outcomes. Analyze factors like strike zone consistency, tendency to call certain types of pitches, and overall game management.

Injury Prediction: Use historical data to predict the likelihood of player injuries. Explore correlations between factors like playing time, travel schedules, and injury rates. Build a model to predict the risk of injury for individual players or teams.

Fan Engagement Analysis: Analyze attendance data and identify factors that influence fan attendance. Explore how factors like team performance, weather, promotions, and opponent influence attendance levels.

Game Length Prediction: Predict the duration of baseball games based on various factors such as teams playing, starting pitchers, day/night games, etc. This could help in scheduling and planning for broadcasters, fans, and stadium personnel.

Clutch Performance Analysis: Analyze player performance in high-pressure situations (e.g., late-game situations, bases loaded). Identify players who perform exceptionally well under pressure and those who struggle.

Sabermetrics Analysis: Dive into advanced baseball statistics like WAR (Wins Above Replacement), wOBA (Weighted On-Base Average), and FIP (Fielding Independent Pitching). Explore their correlations with game outcomes and player salaries.

Overview

Business Understanding

In the highly competitive and financially driven landscape of professional baseball, accurately predicting game outcomes can significantly impact team performance, fan engagement, and revenue generation. By leveraging historical game data our predictive modeling approach aims to provide teams, broadcasters, and stakeholders with actionable insights into future game outcomes. This predictive analytics tool will empower teams to optimize their strategies, such as player selection, pitching rotations, and in-game tactics, leading to improved win rates and overall performance. Additionally, broadcasters can enhance viewer experience by offering more informed pre-game analysis and real-time predictions during broadcasts. Ultimately, a reliable predictive model for baseball game outcomes has the potential to drive fan excitement, increase ticket sales, and attract valuable sponsorships, thus contributing to the long-term success and profitability of baseball organizations.
